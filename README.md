# chessAI
Group 3 chess AI
Nivedh wrote alpha beta pruning and everyone 
helped with debugging; Shreya & Linda helped 
figure out things from the chess module and 
what the functions were; Nivedh & Aydin wrote
the eval function, Linda helped with 
implementing the position eval tables; Everyone
helped write quiescent search; everyone spent
hours together on discord agonizing over why
our ai does stupid things and keeps timing out.
